# 2.5DPlatformerDemo
This is a simple version of a 2.5D Platformer. The player can move left and right using 'A' and 'D' and jump (and double jump) using the spacebar. This was built using Unity and C#.
Since it is a demo/test version of the features of such a game, there is no 'Win' state in the game. However, all the main features of such a game can be seen.

# Running the Game
The game can be run by going into the "Windows Playable Build" directory and running the executable file there. This build is only for a device run using the Windows operating system.
